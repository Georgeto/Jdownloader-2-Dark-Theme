# Jdownloader 2 Dark Theme
After seeing so many requests for a dark theme, I configured my own. 
It uses the "Black Eye" UserInterfaceSetting and a matching colorscheme I configured for the rest of the window. 
I have not found anywhere it looks strange or where you cant read the text. 
I hope someone finds good use for it :)

## Installation
1. Go to `Settings -> Settings` and select the `Advanced Settings` category from the list on the left.
2. Enter `LookAndFeelTheme` into the search field.
3. Only the setting `GraphicalUserInterfaceSettings: Look and Feel Theme` should remain. Set its value to `BLACK_EYE`.
4. Go to `File -> Backup -> Backup all settings` and make a backup of your JDownloader settings.
5. Make a copy of the backup, because we are going to modify it in the next step.
6. Open the backup with the zip archiver of your choice (e.g. [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)).
7. Copy the content of the [config](config/) folder into the opened backup. If asked, confirm overwriting exisiting files.
8. Save the modified backup, if your archiver does not to that automatically.
9. Go to `File -> Backup -> Restore Settings` and choose the modified backup.
10. JD2 will restart now.

Now you got a Dark theme for JD2!
